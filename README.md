# Behind the Queries: Debugging GraphQL Like a Pro

- https://www.meetup.com/graphql-bangkok/events/296635356/

When resolving a GraphQL query, lots of operations could be happening under the hood, for example, you could be:

Making database calls
Invoking nested resolvers
Calling other subgraphs
Linking in your custom business logic
From button click to database call, how much do you really know what's going on? With tools like Network Inspector only giving you the first part of the equation ‘browser to server’, you are left to your own devices.
